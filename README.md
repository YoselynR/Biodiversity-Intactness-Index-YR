# Biodiversity Intactness Index 
This repository is part of a project for the MEDS program EDS 220 class
## About

This repository contains 1 notebook.

**1** This repository contains a notebook 'Biodiversity-Intactness-Index.ipynb' analyzing the BII change from 2017 to 2020. 

## Highlights

- Accessing stac files
- Saving a shapefile
- Loading in data with several libraries
- Masking rasters with shapefile geometry
- Matching CRS of the shapefile and rasters 
- Mapping the Phoenix subdivision 
- Visualizing areas of biodiversity loss
  
## Data

`None of the data is housed in this repositiory due to size, you can find the data below`

The dataset for the Phoenix subdivision is from [Census.gov](https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php?year=2020&layergroup=County+Subdivisions) in which the state Arizona was selected from the dropdown menu. 

The datset for BII was downloaded from the stac file available at [Microsoft Planetary Computer STAC catalog](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/io-biodiversity).
